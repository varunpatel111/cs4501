1) As a user, I would like to view the postings who's start dates are nearest on the home page in order to make an educated purchase in the future

2) As a user, if I click on a particular posting on the home page, I would like to find more information about that posting. Again, this is in order to make an educated purchase

3) As a user, I would like a fast and easy way to contact the user who created the listing I'm interested in, in order to facilitate a conversation about actually making the purchase

4) As a seller, I would like to create, modify, and delete listings that I may have available, because that information is always changing, and I need to make sure my customers can see the changes

6) As a user, I would like to be able to update my account information at any time, if my email changes, I need to be able to still contact other people on the website

7) As a seller, I would like to upload multiple pictures of the listing I am posting, in order to provide a more wholesome view of the listing I am offering.
